# Quake-style FPS Clone

A simple web-based First Person Shooter (FPS) game built with **Three.js** and **Vite**, featuring retro-style graphics and mechanics.

## 🎮 Features

*   **FPS Controller**: Classic WASD movement with acceleration/friction physics.
*   **Mouse Look**: Pointer Lock API for immersive cursor-free aiming.
*   **Combat**: Hitscan weapon system with recoil, muzzle flash, and enemy damage logic.
*   **Enemies**: Basic AI targets (red blocks) that react to damage and can be destroyed.
*   **Level**: Procedurally generated environment with random obstacles and lighting.
*   **Retro Aesthetics**: Disable antialiasing and simple geometry for that 90s feel.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v14+ recommended)
*   npm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository (if applicable) or navigate to the project folder.
2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running Locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to the URL shown (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Building for Production

Create a strictly static build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` folder.

## 🕹️ Controls

*   **Click** on the screen to capture mouse (Start/Resume).
*   **W / A / S / D**: Move Forward / Left / Backward / Right.
*   **Mouse**: Look around.
*   **Left Click**: Shoot.
*   **ESC**: Release mouse cursor (Pause).

## 📂 Codebase Structure

The project uses Vanilla JavaScript with ES Modules.

*   **`main.js`**: Application entry point. Sets up the HTML DOM (crosshair) and initializes the `Game` instance.
*   **`src/Game.js`**: The central engine.
    *   Manages `THREE.Scene`, `THREE.Camera`, and `THREE.Renderer`.
    *   Runs the requestAnimationFrame loop (`update()` method).
    *   Orchestrates the Player, Level, Weapon, and Enemy systems.
*   **`src/Player.js`**: Handles user input and physics.
    *   Uses `PointerLockControls` for camera rotation.
    *   Calculates velocity with simple friction and acceleration logic for smooth movement.
    *   Handles basic floor collision.
*   **`src/Level.js`**: Generates the world.
    *   Creates the floor and random `collidables` (boxes).
    *   Sets up the scene lighting (Ambient + Directional).
*   **`src/Weapon.js`**: Implements shooting mechanics.
    *   `shoot()`: Uses `THREE.Raycaster` from the center of the screen.
    *   Manages the visual gun model attached to the camera, including recoil and muzzle flash effects.
*   **`src/Enemy.js`**: Simple game entities.
    *   `takeDamage()`: Handles health and "death" animations (color flash, removal from scene).
    *   `update()`: Logic for looking at the player (billboarding effect).

## 🛠️ Customization

*   **Level Layout**: Modify `src/Level.js` to change the number of walls or randomness.
*   **Movement Speed**: Adjust `this.moveSpeed` or friction values in `src/Player.js`.
*   **Weapon Stats**: Tweaks fire rate or damage in `src/Weapon.js`.
